					This phase reveals usersâ€™ pain points and gaps in user flows; it is important to test the validity
					of all perceptions from designers and stakeholders. After the testing sessions, UX researchers will
					analyse the findings thoroughly and will provide a full range of design solutions. Task analysis -
					Tasks are pre-determined, and a researcher will observe as a user is completing those tasks and ask
					questions to better understand pain points. This testing often reveals specific pain points as well
					as gaps in user flows. A/B testing - a controlled experiment to compare versions of a page or flow
					in order to optimize a single page (ex. increasing the number of sign ups by changing the color of a
					button in a website). The SUS rating scale - a questionnaire that the user completes to give an
					overall satisfaction score, and is a typical measures of usability (the official measure of user
					satisfaction).
