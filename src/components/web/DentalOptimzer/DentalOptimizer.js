							<p className="m-projCopy-top">
								Dental Optimizer is a web based app which houses a suite of tools for dental patients:
								an insurance dashboard, ask a dentist, find a dentist, appointment request, cost
								calculator, risk assessments, and more.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div className="m-twoColumnCopy">
							<h2 className="m-projTitleGroup">The Challenge</h2>
							<p className="m-projCopy-top">
								The previous iteration of this site required a complete re-design to clarify the user
								experience and communication of information.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div className="l-w1 animated delay2">
						<h2 className="m-projTitleGroup">User Research</h2>
						<p className="m-projCopy l-2cl">
							Deloitte conducted user research to understand user interactions within the site's previous
							iteration. Results revealed specific pain points while using the site. Our team began by
							mapping out the user journey for both providers and patients, and discovered non-relevant
							content within certain user flows. As well, content was commonly condensed on the site, with
							non-releated information being presented side-by-side, hindering usability.
						</p>
						<h2 className=" m-projTitleGroup">The Takeaway</h2>
						<p className="m-projCopy blackText l-2cl">
							The site update removed un-related content from user flows, and content was modified to fit
							a more vertically-oriented format (no longer presenting unrelated content side-by-side).
							Each page was simplified with a white background, and the type treatments and iconography
							were re-imagined, inspired by Googleâ€™s Material Design. Artistic illustrations were added to
							bring a soft and human feel to the otherwise technical site.

						three available time slots for the patient to choose from. Appointment notifications are served
						up in-browser as well as via email.
